cfront v3
=========

This is a project for a self education and historical research of the
C++ compiler. 

A cfront compiler can help to get a concrete understanding how
vtbls, class objects and so on really look like.

Additionally cfront can provide a useful platform to compile historic C++
programs.


PS: a sources was taken from the cfront re-port for the 4th edition of plan9
    http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sources/extra/c++.2e.tgz
    http://9p.io/sources/contrib/john/package/packages/cfront.iso.bz2

PPS: features not implement in cfront 3.x

    Support for the `volatile' keyword.
    Support for the `signed' keyword.
    Support for wide character literals.
    Support for wide character strings.
    Exceptions.
    - Support for the `long long` type (done)

## Notes

Fix the issues of compilation under Ubuntu.

    # Ubuntu package needed:
    sudo apt install byacc

    # Build
    make

    # Demo
    make demo

    # Clean
    make clean

The extension `.C` was changed to `.cpp` to allow build on operating systems with case insensitive filesystems (OSX, WINDOWS).

I've included the generated parser so you don't need `yacc/byacc` installed to build it.

To build on OSX and Windows under MSYS2 I still need some hack fixes not included here yet (pull requests are wellcome).

It can build itself through valgrind without any invalid memory access (of course it leaks memory as usual for this kind of software and it's epoch).
